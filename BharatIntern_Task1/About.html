<h1>Hi! I'm Maitri Markandeywar.</h1>
<p>A student, Currently persuing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Shree Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management,Nagpur.</p>
<p> I was born and brought up in Nagpur. Since childhood ,I was always attracted towards nature and fasinated towards finding solutions to conserve it. Growing up I developed my intrest towards problem solving and firmly belived that yes where there is a problem we ought to develop a solution.This attitude of problem solving made me fasinated towards computer science even more.</p>
<p>Being ever evolving and intresting field arouse my intrest towards this subject even more.
    Surely want to work out towards conserving my nature,my mother earth with this technical knowlege that 
    I will gain.
</p>
<p>
As rightly said by Angela Bassett, we should never settle for average and this magic mantra is what inspires me always and keeps me going through...even if at sometimes I feel like giving up I suggest my self no I am not someone ordinary....I remind my self of my goals of conserving nature and that is what keeps me going.
